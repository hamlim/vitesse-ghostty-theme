# Vitesse Themes for Ghostty

A set of themes for [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty) based on the [Vitesse Theme for VS Code](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-theme-vitesse), based on the [iTerm2 themes](https://github.com/HiDeoo/iTerm2-theme-vitesse).

Download the files and place them in:

- macOS
  - `~/.config/ghostty/themes`

I also wrote a brief blog post on how to use these themes + how to create custom themes for Ghostty, [give it a read here](https://matthamlin.me/blog/2024/october/building-a-custom-ghostty-theme)!
